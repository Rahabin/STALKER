# Weapon Mods Patch

Description:

This patch was initially designed to harmoniously patch some weapon mods for my personal use.

Although not being the biggest fan of Provak's way of handling his packs, I designed my patches around them because they combined some older weapon mods otherwise
hard to find nowadays. That presents the advantage that these patches will work with (mostly) any combination of those mods that may not necessarily be bundled
together in a pack.

Any suggestion of mods that may work well with that pack and that would require a patch is welcome. I haven't thoroughly tested the functionality of each part of
the patches either, so any bug reports are also appreciated.

Alas, hope those who may come into contact with this repo will find it somwhat useful.

Good afternoon, good evening and good night, and most of all, good hunting, Stalkers!
